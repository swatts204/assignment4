       <h2>Your Average Sneaker Head</h2>
       <p>I became infatuated with sneakers at the tender age 
           of 10. My parents had always bought me nice sneakers. However,
           it wasn't until my 10th birthday, when I fell in love with the 
           Air Jordan XV. Ever since that day I walked to the sneaker store
           by myself and bought these sneakers with my own money I had 
           collected for my birthday, I knew that sneakers would have a permanent
           place in my life.
