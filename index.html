            <h2>Your Average Sneaker Head</h2>
                 <p>I became infatuated with sneakers at the tender age 
                    of 10. My parents had always bought me nice sneakers. However,
                    it wasn't until my 10th birthday, when I fell in love with the 
                    Air Jordan XV. I had been eyeing them for a month. On my birthday,
                    I collected all of the money my parents gave me and walked to the mall
                    to buy them. The price tag on a size 7 (a size 7 was considered a men's size back then)
                    was $150. Ever since that day, I knew that sneakers would have a permanent
                    place in my life.
                </p>
                <h2>Sneaker Restoration</h2>
                <p> As my sneaker collection began to grow, I noticed had sneakers that sat for years that were barely worn.
                    They were starting to fall apart. It felt like a waste. My kicks were losing value. That's when I became curious about 
                    sneaker restoration. I found an entire community online that gave awesome tips on
                    what products to buy, different techniques to use, and a host of resources to aid me in my journey.
                    Check out this awesome restoration I've completed on these Fire Red IV's!</p>
           
                    <img src="./img.jpg./before.jpg" alt="Sneaker Art" style="width:385px;height:300px;">
                  
                   
                 <p>When I was challenged by a customer to clean up these Jordan IV's, I was super excited and nervous
                    at the same time. I had never restored a pair of IV's and from what I researched, midsoles were very
                    tricky to repaint. As you can see in this first picture, the paint on the midsole is chipped and could 
                    use a good touch up. Afterall, this is a 2012 release still surviving in 2019.</p>
               
                    <img src="./img.jpg./Sneaker-assign4.jpg" alt="Sneaker Art" style="width:385px;height:300px;">
                   
                 <p>In the second picture, you'll notice
                    that I stripped away all of the old paint on the midsole using Angelus Leather Preparer and Deglazer. Sometimes I use
                    acetone, but Angelus Direct is great and sells everything I need to restore a shoe. Those black spots you see still
                    remaining on the midsole is actually where the customer tried to color in the midsoles with a permanent marker. LOL!
                    Don't ever do that to your kicks! Just bring them to me.</p>
               
                    <img src="./img.jpg./after.jpg" alt="Sneaker Art" style="width:385px;height:345px;">
                <p> Finally, after a thorough 
                    scrubbing using Angelus sneaker cleaner, a fresh repaint to the midsole was applied with a layer of 2-Hard, and viola!
                    These Fire Red IV's are back in action. I'd be proud to wear these on my feet!</p>
                    
                    <h2>TIPS FOR FIRST TIMERS!</h2>
                    <p>I just want to share as much information as I can with anyone curious about sneaker restoration or
                        customization. So here are a few tips! 
                      <ol>  
                        <li>Angelus Direct has just about everything you 
                        need to start restoring your kicks. Their products are pretty good and the prices are fair. They have a starter kit
                        that is great for beginners. 
                        <li>When painting your kicks, taping is very essential. Always tape off any area you do not want to paint.
                        <li>Always prep your areas with the Deglazer or acetone. When a shoe comes from the factory, the leather has
                            a coat of wax over it that you can't immediately see. You want to remove that wax layer with the Deglazer 
                            before you paint the area. This will allow your paint to adhere to the leather itself.</li>
                        <li>Invest in a heat gun. You can find them for around $20. You should let each layer of paint dry before
                            applying the next layer. The heat gun can speed up that process.</li>
                        <li>If you're serious about restoration and customizing, an airbrush would be very helpful
                            in your journey. It allows you to apply your paint more evenly and speeds up the process.</li>
                      </ol>
